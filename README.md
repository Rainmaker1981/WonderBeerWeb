# 🍺 WonderBEER

**WonderBEER** is a Python-based beer recommendation app that helps you answer three questions:

- **What beer do I like?**
- **What beer do I want to drink right now?**
- **Have you ever went into a brewery and looked at all the selections and wondered what would be the best for me?**

- Taste preferences (ABV, IBU, beer styles)
